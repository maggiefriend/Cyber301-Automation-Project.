# Dishonest Capacity Calculator
**Course:** CYBER301  
**Author:** Maggie Friend  
**Book Reference:** *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart (Chapter 2: Flow Control)

## 📘 Description
This Python program calculates the *real* storage capacity of a hard drive or flash drive, based on how manufacturers often advertise their sizes using decimal (10-based) rather than binary (2-based) units.

For example, a drive advertised as 1 TB is actually about 0.91 TB when measured in true binary units.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the advertised unit (GB or TB).
2. Asks for the advertised capacity.
3. Calculates the real capacity using the proper binary conversion ratio.
4. Displays both the advertised and actual values.
